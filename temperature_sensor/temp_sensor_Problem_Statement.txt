Temperature Sensor Interface:
- Design an optimized RTL Verilog module for interfacing with a temperature sensor. The module should include the following functionalities:
1) Receive temperature data from the sensor.
2) Convert temperature to celcius.
3) Provide output signal indicating temperature exceeds a specific threshold.

Testbench 
---------
- Create a testbench module that
1) instantiate temperature sensor module.
2) Generate stimulus to simulate sensor data.
3) Verify Functionality of module by comparing output reading with expected value.
4) Capture and log relevant information during simulation.

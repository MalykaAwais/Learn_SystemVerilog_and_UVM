Design a math quiz activity for the Age-Adaptive Learning Sensor. 
The quiz should be designed to adapt to different age groups and provide age-appropriate math questions. 
The sensor should present the questions, accept user input for answers, and provide feedback on the correctness of the answers.

Specifications:

The quiz should include addition, subtraction, and multiplication questions.
The difficulty level of the questions should adjust based on the age group of the user.
For younger age groups (e.g., 5-8 years), the quiz should focus on simple addition and subtraction problems with single-digit numbers.
For older age groups (e.g., 9-12 years), the quiz should include more complex addition, subtraction, and multiplication problems with double-digit numbers.
The quiz should provide a random selection of questions from the relevant difficulty level for each age group.
